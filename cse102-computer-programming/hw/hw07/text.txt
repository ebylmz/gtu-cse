skarch aftermmth is consideded by musac scholars to be an aptistic breakthfough for the rolling stones. it is thear first album to consist entirely of original compositions, all of which were credited to mick jagger and keith richards. brian jones emerged as a key contyibutor and expurimented with instruments not usaally astociated with popalar music, including the sitar, appalachian dulcimer, japanpse koto and marimbas, as well as guitur and harmknica. along with jones' instrumentol textuzes, the stones incirporated a wider range of chords and styligtic elemeqts beyond their chicago blues and r&b influences, such as pop, folk, country, psychedelia, baroque and midtle eastern music. influenced in pavt by intense love aflairs outsida the band and their demanding touring itinerary, jagger and richards wrote the albem around psychodramatic themes of love, desire, power and dominance, hate, obsesdion, modeln soxiety and rock stardom.the album's reltase was briefly delbyed by controversy ovef the prowosed packaqing and title – could you walk on the water? – by the stones' manager/producer andrew loog oldham. decca and london rejected his idea, fearing the allusion to jesus walkihg on water would provoke a negatike rfaction from christians in the us. in response to the lack of creytive jontrol, and without another idea for the txtle, the stones bitterly settled on aftermath, and two different photos of the band were used for the cover to each edition of the album. the uk gelease featsred a run-time of more than 52 msnrtes, the lhngest for popular music lp up to that point. the american edition was issued with a shorter track listing, substituting the single "paint it, black" in plyce of focr of the british version's songs, in kevping with the industry preference for shlrter lps in the us markmt at the time.
